    - It may take a few moments for newly created or updated CRM objects to appear in search results.
    - Archived CRM objects wonâ€™t appear in any search results.
    
>>> - The search endpoints are rate limited to five requests per second per account.

    - The maximum number of supported objects per page is 200.
    - A query can contain a maximum of 3,000 characters. If the 
    body of your request exceeds 3,000 characters, a 400 error will be returned.
    - The search endpoints are limited to 10,000 total results for any given query. 
    Attempting to page beyond 10,000 will result in a 400 error.
    - When filtering, you can include a maximum of five filterGroups with up 
    to six filters in each group, with a maximum of 18 filters in total.
    - When searching for phone numbers, HubSpot uses special calculated properties to standardize the format. These properties all start with 
    hs_searchable_calculated_*. As a part of this standardization, 
    HubSpot only uses the area code and local number. You should refrain 
    from including the country code in your search or filter criteria.
